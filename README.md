# Custom Elements Repository

Welcome to my Custom Elements repository! In this space, you will find a collection of Custom Elements created by me, using only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. These customized elements can be easily incorporated into your projects to add unique functionalities and specific stylings.

## About Custom Elements

Custom Elements are personalized HTML components that allow the creation of new custom HTML tags with specific behaviors. They are built based on the native specifications of web browsers and can be reused in various parts of a project.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the list of available Custom Elements in the <code>src</code> directory.

2. Choose a Custom Element that you want to use in your project.

3. In your project directory, you can copy the HTML and JavaScript code of the desired Custom Element.

4. Paste the code into your project and adjust classes and IDs as needed.

5. VoilÃ ! Now you have a new customized component in your project.
